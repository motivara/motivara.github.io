<p class="about"><span class="nf">About:</span><br>
  I love to design solutions for clients. I am primarily concerned with gleaning the facts to understand the needs of the end user. I approach each project with care, from a broad picture to the finest of details where every pixel matters.
<br><br><br>
  I earned a Master of Design from Carnegie Mellon University in Communication Planning and Information Design. I have taught design at Carnegie Mellon University and mentored designers online. My undergraduate degree is a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Kent State University majoring in graphic design.
<br><br><br>
  I never stop learning. I have studied advanced design topics in London and Switzerland. Recently, I earned online certificates from the MIT-AI Media Lab for Artificial Intelligence, and HCI, Human Computer Interaction from the Interaction Design Foundation. I have been researching the fields of interaction design, computer science, and engineering. I remain current with UX/UI software tools such as Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. I utilize After Effects and Adobe Premiere Pro for storytelling and motion graphics. I create prototypes with HTML and CSS code. I collaborate with seasoned developers to add functionality and interactivity.
<br><br><br>
  I worked as a product designer for Microsoft Corporation. Currently, as an entrepreneur, I own and operate Motivara Corporation, a design consultancy based in Redmond, WA. For many years, I worked in Pittsburgh as a designer, and won numerous awards including AIGA, Women in Communications, Printing Association, and Society of Technical Communications. American Corporate Identity selected several of my logo designs to display in their annual publications. I am a member of IEEE, ACM, and the TDC (Type Directors Club).
<br><br><br>
  Additionally, I co-founded kynamatrix Research Network, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, with a mission to advance innovation through collaboration. We are seeking to answer the research question: "How can we improve the logistics of provisioning products and services for those left homeless in the aftermath of disaster?" We also recognize and reward innovative projects within US-based university masters and PhD academic programs.</p>
